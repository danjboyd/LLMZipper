# LLM Zipper

LLM Zipper is a desktop utility written in **Perl + Gtk3** for organizing, previewing, and packaging project files into a single ZIP archive or copying their contents to the clipboard for use with large language models (LLMs).

It was designed to make it easier to assemble and share code/data snippets across multiple folders without leaving your editor.
